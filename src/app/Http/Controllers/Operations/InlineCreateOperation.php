     *
     *  We use this setup to make this operation behaviour similar to other operations, so developer could still override
     *  the defaults with `setupInlineCreateOperation` as with any other operation.
     *
     *  `setupInlineCreateDefaults` is not used because of the time it is called in the stack. The "defaults" are applied in backpack
     *  to all operations, before applying operation specific setups. As this operation directly need to call other
     *  methods in the CrudController, it should only be "initialized" when it's requested.
     *
     *  To solve the mentioned problems we initialize the operation defaults at the same time we apply developer setup. Developer settings
     *  are applied after the defaults to prevail.
